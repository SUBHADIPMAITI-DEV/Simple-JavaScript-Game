# Game Description
"Tetris" is a classic tile-matching puzzle game. The objective is to manipulate falling tetrominoes (shapes composed of four square blocks) to create complete horizontal lines. When a line is completed, it is removed, and the player earns points. The game ends when the tetrominoes stack up to the top of the playing field.
